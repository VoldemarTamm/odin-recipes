            <li>1 (16 ounce) package mostaccioli pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar picante sauce</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook mostaccioli at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.<p></p></li>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.<p></p></li>
            <li>Add picante sauce and stewed tomatoes to the ground beef; cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften completely, about 10 minutes. Gently stir the cooked mostaccioli into the ground beef mixture. Add Mexican-style cheese; cook and stir until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.<p></p></li>
